# Searchs Project REST API
This is academic, I'm madding 6 types of searchs, 3 without infos and 3 with info, this just the backend server, the front and mobile will be done in a near future.

## Commands
dev -> "npm run dev" or "yarn dev"

### Necessary configurations
I created a folder called config on the project root, and a file inside, called "dev.env" and put the MongoDB address URL, in there I have 2 variables "DB_URL", this is where I will put the mongo address and the PORT.
